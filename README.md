AngularStrap is a set of native directives that enables seamless integration of [Bootstrap 3.0+](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) into your [AngularJS 1.2+](https://github.com/angular/angular.js) app.

- The only required dependency is [Bootstrap CSS Styles](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/dist/css/bootstrap.css)!

>
AngularStrap was initially written to provide AngularJS wrapping directives for Bootstrap. It used to leverage the JavaScript code written by Bootstrap's contributors to minimize work, retro-compatibility issues & time to market.
>
While it worked pretty well, it required a big JavaScript payload: both jQuery & Bootstrap libraries. When the 1.2 release of AngularJS showed up with the ngAnimate module, greatly simplifying DOM manipulation, we knew it was time for a rewrite!

- If you don't want to use `ngAnimate`, you will have to include a tiny [ngAnimate mock](https://github.com/mgcrea/angular-strap/wiki/ngAnimate-mock).

## Documentation and examples

+ Check the [documentation](http://mgcrea.github.io/angular-strap) and [changelog](https://github.com/mgcrea/angular-strap/releases).
