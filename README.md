AngularStrap is a set of native directives that enables seamless integration of [Bootstrap 3.0+](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) into your [AngularJS 1.2+](https://github.com/angular/angular.js) app.

- The only required dependency is [Bootstrap CSS Styles](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/dist/css/bootstrap.css)!

>
AngularStrap was initially written to provide AngularJS wrapping directives for Bootstrap. It used to leverage the JavaScript code written by Bootstrap's contributors to minimize work, retro-compatibility issues & time to market.
>
While it worked pretty well, it required a big JavaScript payload: both jQuery & Bootstrap libraries. When the 1.2 release of AngularJS showed up with the ngAnimate module, greatly simplifying DOM manipulation, we knew it was time for a rewrite!

- If you don't want to use `ngAnimate`, you will have to include a tiny [ngAnimate mock](https://github.com/mgcrea/angular-strap/wiki/ngAnimate-mock).

## Documentation and examples

+ Check the [documentation](http://mgcrea.github.io/angular-strap) and [changelog](https://github.com/mgcrea/angular-strap/releases).


## Quick start

+ Install AngularStrap with [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower).

>
```bash
$ bower install angular-strap --save
```

+ Include the required libraries is your `index.html`:

>
``` html
<script src="bower_components/angular/angular.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular-strap/dist/angular-strap.min.js"></script>
<script src="bower_components/angular-strap/dist/angular-strap.tpl.min.js"></script>
```

+ Inject the `mgcrea.ngStrap` module into your app:

>
``` js
angular.module('myApp', ['mgcrea.ngStrap']);
```


## Developers

Clone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/mgcrea/angular-strap.git`, [download the latest release](https://github.com/mgcrea/angular-strap/zipball/master) or install with bower `bower install angular-strap --save`.

AngularStrap is tested with `karma` against the latest stable release of AngularJS.

>
	$ npm install --dev
	$ gulp test

You can build the latest version using `gulp`.

>
	$ gulp build

You can quickly hack around (the docs) with:

>
	$ gulp serve
