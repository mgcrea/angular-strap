AngularStrap is a set of native directives that enables seamless integration of [Twitter Bootstrap 3.0+](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap) into your [AngularJS 1.2+](https://github.com/angular/angular.js) app.

>
AngularStrap was initially written to provide AngularJS wrapping directives for Twitter Bootstrap. It used to leverage the javascript code written by Bootstrap's contributors to minimize work, retro-compatibility issues & time to market.
>
While it worked pretty well, it required a big javascript payload: both jQuery & Twitter Bootstrap libraries. When the 1.2 release of AngularJS showed up with the ngAnimate module, greatly simplifying DOM manipulation, we knew it was time for a rewrite!

## Documentation and examples

+ Check the [documentation](http://mgcrea.github.io/angular-strap) and [changelog](https://github.com/mgcrea/angular-strap/releases).



## Quick start

+ Include the required libraries (`ngAnimate` can be [mocked out](https://github.com/mgcrea/angular-strap/wiki/angular-animate-mock.js), only the `$$animateReflow` service is used).

>
``` html
<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.10/angular.min.js"></script>
<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.10/angular-animate.min.js"></script>
<script src="//rawgithub.com/mgcrea/angular-strap/master/dist/angular-strap.min.js"></script>
<script src="//rawgithub.com/mgcrea/angular-strap/master/dist/angular-strap.tpl.min.js"></script>
```


+ Inject the `ngStrap` module into your app

>
``` javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['mgcrea.ngStrap']);
```


## Developers

Clone the repo, `git clone git://github.com/mgcrea/angular-strap.git`, [download the latest release](https://github.com/mgcrea/angular-strap/zipball/master) or install with bower `bower install angular-strap#~2.0.0 --save`.

AngularStrap is tested with `karma` against the latest stable release of AngularJS.

>
	$ npm install grunt-cli --global
	$ npm install --dev
	$ grunt test

You can build the latest version using `grunt`.

>
	$ grunt build

You can quickly hack around (the docs) with:

>
	$ grunt serve
